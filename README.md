# Navigating-the-Farm-Data-Standards
Guides for navigating and interpreting the [Farm Data Standards](http://www.farmdatastandards.org.nz/data-standards/)
##Which Guide to Use?
With a growing number of farm data standards available, with overlapping properties within each standard, it can be difficult to determine which guide will contain the information you're looking for. Below is an overview for each standard including a description and key features within each guide to help you find what you're looking for.

##Animal Data Standard
This standard addresses the following areas:
* The identification of animals, herds, and locations
*	Animal “life data” including animal characteristics, parentage, and state information.
*	Representation of collective groups of animals ranging from herds or flocks, physical management groups such as mobs through to logical groups for analysis and planned groups such as a draft list.
*	Observations including records of an activity carried out, events that have occurred and measurements that have been taken. Obversations included in this standard include animal movements, reproduction, feed and growth, health treatments, tests, and scoring / grading.

##Farm Features & Attributes Data Standard
This standard relates to Features that are useful at a farm scale, *which have a spatial representation and that are likely to be interchanged*. The standard builds on and complements existing data standards such as those developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium and the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe.
The standard addresses:
*	Identification of Farm Features using a feature catalogue.
*	The attributes of the Farm Features and references to source documents using a Data Dictionary.
*	Farm Emergency Locations
*	Enumerations relating to Agricultural Buildings and activity values for land (Plot activity values).

##Financial Data Standard
This standard addresses the following areas of data interchange:
*	Representing transactional financial information, either in budget or actual transactions;
*	Representing balance sheet information; and
*	Representing key performance indicators typically used in benchmarking or comparison of farm systems, or in concert with financial reporting of a farming enterprise.
The data dictionaries defined in this standard are intended to support standardised interchange of financial data for benchmarking, tools, and analysis, and are not intended as a mechanism for E-Commerce (other standards such as EDIFACT, UBL and EANCOM/GS1 XML support this).

##Farm & Model Data Standard
This standard addresses data relating to the Farm entity, including spatial features on the farm along with enterprise details, metrics, land application, and physical characteristics of land. This Standard relies on the OVERSEER Data Standards along with referencing other Farm Data Standards where applicable:
*	Identification of farm feature characteristics, including spatial farm entity data.
*	Organisational attributes, including business details, supply number, and personnel details. 
*	Key Farm metrics as applicable to different enterprise types; including dairy, sheep and beef, and deer enterprises.
*	Data relating to blocks of lands, termed as “Management Blocks”.
*	Land application attributes, including feed, grazing, irrigation, and fertilizer.
*	Climate zones and soil attributes.

##Health & Safety Data Standard
This standard relates to the management of Health and Safety on farm.
The standard addresses:
*	Hazards and Risks; including Activity, AgriBuilding/Installation, Biological, Climatic/Natural, Environmental, Equipment, Hazardous Substance, and Vehicles.
*	People and Roles 
*	Events; including Audit/Review, Environmental, Maintenance, Inspection, Notifiable Event, 'Accident, Incident or Near Miss', Training, Meeting, and Reports.

##Irrigation & Effluent Data Standard 
This standard addresses the following areas:
*	Irrigation equipment and water supply
*	Production, collection, storage, and treatment of effluent
*	Irrigation and effluent application
*	Characteristics of soil focusing on those related to soil moisture
*	Use of water by plants
*	Climatic observations relevant to irrigation and the spreading of effluent

##Land Application Data Standard
This standard addresses the data required for both the planned and the actual applications of fertiliser, herbicide and pesticide.
The information specified includes:
*	the customer order
*	the area spread
*	product details including nutrient information
*	spatial representation of the spread and spray tracks and of any ecological hot-spots. 

##Pasture, Grazing & Feed Data Standard
This standard addresses the following areas:
*	Harvesting, purchase, storage, utilisation and sale of supplementary feeds.
*	Grazing observations and summaries of grazing off and grazing systems
*	Pasture growth, pasture, and feed analysis
*	Monitoring of pasture pests and weeds.

##Stock Reconciliation Data Standard
This standard addresses terminology applied by the industry to livestock reconciliations, and any other change of stock numbers data.  The purpose of this document is to standardise terminology and representations of data to ease future interchange of this and other data. 
Key features include:
*	Stock Class attributes and definitions for Cattle, Sheep, Goats, and Deer.
*	Transaction categories and types.
*	Enumeration lists for species, reproduction, fertility, and transactions.
